Board
- ROWS: int = 8
- COLUMNS: int = 8

Piece
- point: Point
+ get_attack_points() -> List[Point]

Player
- pieces: List[Piece]
+ get_piece_points() -> List[Point]
+ get_all_attack_points() -> List[Point]

Game (Client)
+ initial_placement()

Algorithm
---------

initial_placement
    1. If player pieces_points size 8, record piece_points, and return
    2. Iterate points in board
    3. If point in player piece_points or point in player all_attack_points, continue
    4. Give queen at point to player
    5. Recursion
    6. Take queen at point from player
